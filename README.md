# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- ## Directory structure
- The directory structure is organized around the following main components:

-src: This folder contains the source code for the React application.
-assets: This folder contains static assets like images and fonts.
-components: This folder contains reusable React components that make up the UI.
-pages: This folder contains page-specific components and styles.
-App.css: This file contains global styles for the application.
-App.js: This file is the entry point for the React application.
-index.css: This file contains styles for the index.html file.
-index.html: This file is the main HTML document for the application.
-package.json: This file contains dependencies and configuration for the project.
-Specific Directories:

-src/assets: This folder contains a single image file, react.svg. This could be used as a logo or icon for the application.
-src/components: This folder contains three files:
-Search.css: This file contains styles specific to the Search component.
-Search.jsx: This file contains the React code for the Search component, which likely handles the search bar functionality.
-Home.css: This file likely contains styles specific to the Home component, which could be the main page of the application.
-src/pages: This folder contains four files:
-Home.css: This file likely contains styles specific to the Home page.
-Home.jsx: This file likely contains the React code for the Home page.
-SearchPage.css: This file likely contains styles specific to the SearchPage component.
-SearchPage.jsx: This file likely contains the React code for the SearchPage component, which could be displayed when a user submits a search query.
-App.css: This file likely contains global styles that are applied throughout the application.
-App.js: This file is the entry point for the React application. It likely imports and renders the main components of the application.
-index.css: This file likely contains styles specific to the index.html file.
-index.html: This file is the main HTML document for the application. It likely references the App.js file and other necessary assets.
-package.json: This file contains dependencies and configuration for the project. It specifies libraries and tools needed to run and build the application.
